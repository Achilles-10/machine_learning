# Introduction

## **What is Machine learning**
...
$$ \Rightarrow\begin{cases}\rm Supervised\;\;learning\\\rm Unsupervised\;\;learning\end{cases} $$

## **Superbvised Learning**:
1. data set with `correct output`
2. It can be categorized into `regression` and `classification`

$$ \begin{cases}\rm Regression:within\;a\;continuous\;output\\\rm Classification:within\;a\;discrete\;output\end{cases} $$

* **Example**
1. `Regression`:Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture
2. `Classification`:Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## **Unsupervised Learning**

we can derive structures from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables

* **Example**
1. `Clustering`:Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.
2. `Non-clustering`:The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment.
